* Group project (30%)
    * First part presented at the end of week 2.
    * Second part presented at the end of week 4.
* Final exam (50%)
    * After all classes.

Students need to participate in class quizzes for at least 2 times. Best 2 out of 3.

You will develop a coding project using a public dataset and create a data analysis
pipeline that must pass a series of tests. The tests will be executed in the pytest framework. The code of the project will be stored in a repository together with instructions on how to generate an appropriate virtual environment. Anyone with the instructions should be able to clone the repository, install the virtual environment, and run the analysis developed by the students.
